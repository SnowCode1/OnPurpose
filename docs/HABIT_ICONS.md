# Optional habit icons

Requested by the founder on 4 October 2026. A habit may have no icon, an emoji, or
a monochrome pack icon. Existing habits remain name-only until edited. An icon
appears beside the name in the grid, statistics, and archive list. It is decorative
for accessibility: the habit's name remains its spoken identity. Icons never
replace names or shrink date-cell touch targets.

## Selection

Hold a habit name → Edit habit → Icon, or use Icon while adding a habit.

The editor presents compact Icon and Colour buttons side by side, with symbol
and swatch previews. They wrap at larger font sizes. Detailed icon names and hex
values stay in their pickers rather than occupying separate editor rows.

- **Icons** is always the initial tab, including for no-icon and emoji habits.
  Opening/browsing alone does not change the saved choice. The combined catalogue
  has 6,678 icons: 1,512 Phosphor Regular and 5,166 Tabler Outline.
- Browse **Common**, **All**, **Phosphor**, or **Tabler**. Common combines the
  original 56 Phosphor habits with 12 activity choices from Tabler.
- Search always covers both complete packs, matching multiple words across names,
  aliases, categories, and tags. Typing replaces the browse filters with
  **Searching all icons / Both packs** and a result count. Clearing restores the
  previous browse filter. Habit vocabulary maps meditation/meditate/mindfulness
  to yoga. Exact names rank first, then common habit choices.
- **Emoji** offers 32 presets and a field for the system emoji keyboard or paste.
  Emoji keep their platform appearance. Skin tones, joined sequences, flags, and
  keycaps count as one emoji; plain text and multiple emoji do not.
- **None** explicitly removes the icon without reserving empty row space.

Pack icons use the habit's draft colour and follow subsequent colour edits.
Selected names include their pack; accessible choice labels distinguish packs.

The picker's Done applies to the editor draft; the editor's Done saves the habit.
Close discards the current picker/editor draft. The picker replaces the form's
scrolling content and keeps Done visible rather than stacking another long section.
Its own bounded FlatList renders a window of icon rows, with adaptive column count;
it is not nested in the editor ScrollView. Tabs/search scroll with the results so
the picker can shrink in landscape or above the keyboard.

## Assets and code

[Phosphor core](https://github.com/phosphor-icons/core) supplies the regular SVG
paths, pinned to npm `@phosphor-icons/core@2.1.1`. `src/phosphorPaths.ts` contains
the complete regular glyph set. Its [MIT notice](licenses/PHOSPHOR_LICENSE.txt) is retained.
[Tabler](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons) supplies all outline paths and
metadata from npm `@tabler/icons@3.48.0`; generated `src/tablerPaths.ts` preserves
path fill, stroke, and opacity overrides. Its [MIT notice](licenses/TABLER_LICENSE.txt)
is retained. Render on a 24-unit viewBox with 1.5-unit round strokes to sit near
Phosphor Regular’s weight. Neither asset package is a runtime dependency; existing
react-native-svg draws the paths.
There is no remote image fetch and no new native module.

`src/habitIconCatalog.ts` and `src/tablerIconCatalog.ts` own generated stable IDs,
labels, and search terms.
`src/commonHabitIcons.ts` and `src/commonTablerIcons.ts` preserve curated order,
labels, and habit aliases.
`src/searchHabitIcons.ts` indexes the full catalogue for multiword search. Keep saved IDs
and their glyphs when extending the catalogue. `src/HabitSymbol.tsx` draws icons;
`src/HabitIconPicker.tsx` owns selection UI. `src/habitIcons.ts` owns namespaced
values, labels, and validation using pinned `emoji-regex@11.0.0`. Do not tighten
validation on dependency updates without testing previously accepted sequences.

## Persistence

Version 4 adds `icon?: string` to a habit definition, represented as e.g.
`phosphor:book-open`, `tabler:yoga`, or `emoji:📚`. None omits the field. Null, unknown packs/IDs,
URLs, malformed emoji, and extra object fields are rejected before saving/import.
Old v1/v2/v3 events retain their original validation and interpretation. A log may
upgrade but cannot downgrade after a v4 event. The SQL schema stays at version 1.

Applying/removing icons is an ordinary before/after habit-definition change.
It saves atomically, appears in History, survives archive/restore and reload,
and supports Undo/Redo. Icon-only edits read “Icon changed” or “Icon removed”.
The v4 backup exports every raw event, including older events without rewriting.
See [STORAGE.md](STORAGE.md) and [the synthetic v4 backup](examples/storage-v4.json).

Tests cover valid emoji sequences, malformed inputs, catalogue/glyph completeness,
History descriptions, SQLite reload, removal, archive restore, Undo/Redo, legacy
version boundaries, downgrade rejection, and backup round-trips.

## Catalogue scope and regeneration

The founder approved expanding Phosphor on 4 October 2026. All 1,512 distinct
regular designs are now available. The upstream 9k+ total counts six styles:
1,512 × thin/light/regular/bold/fill/duotone = 9,072 assets in core 2.1.1. Regular
covers every design once. The founder subsequently approved Tabler Outline.

To regenerate, download the official npm tarballs for `@phosphor-icons/core@2.1.1`
and `@tabler/icons@3.48.0`,
extract it into an ignored local folder, then run:

```sh
node scripts/generate-phosphor.mjs /absolute/path/to/phosphor/package
node scripts/generate-tabler.mjs /absolute/path/to/tabler/package
```

The generators verify package/version, icon counts, supported SVG/path attributes,
and common IDs; it writes deterministic, formatted catalogue/path modules. These
are committed, so normal development/builds need no asset download. Preserve
the upstream MIT notice and all previously accepted IDs on future upgrades.
Expanded choices use the same v4 representation; older builds with the 56-icon
registry, or builds without Tabler, will reject backups containing unfamiliar IDs. Update the receiving
build before importing those backups.
