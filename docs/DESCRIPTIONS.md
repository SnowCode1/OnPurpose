# Habit descriptions

Date: 5 October 2026. Status: requested by the founder and implemented;
the founder confirmed improved formatting selection and bottom-link-sheet spacing
on the iPhone on 5 October 2026. Broader keyboard, accessibility and recovery
acceptance remains pending.

## Reading and editing

A habit can have an optional description containing plain text or Markdown.
Its purpose is to keep motivation, reminders and links one habit-name tap away.
The founder confirmed the long-note reader feels instant at all three sample
sizes, but wants the full note one tap from the grid. The compact-card experiment
is superseded by a **Notes / Statistics tab trial** in the same habit page sheet.
Name taps open Notes when a description exists and Statistics otherwise. Notes
shows the full formatted reader immediately; there is no preview or second Open
note step. Empty Notes offers Add a note. The common header shows the habit and
Close, with Edit description on Notes and Edit habit on Statistics. Versions
remains available within Notes when history exists.

The first selected panel mounts alone. Each panel remains mounted after its
first visit, preserving reading/statistics scroll, chart selections and ranges
when switching tabs. Inactive panels retain their layout but accept no touches
and are hidden from accessibility. The reader FlatList mounts nearby passages
and splits top-level lists into individual rows, retaining nesting and numbering.
Its disposable cache is capped at five documents/100,000 source characters.
Edit/version/numeric dialogs still present inside the same native sheet;
save failure/retry is visible there. This is an authorised phone trial, not a
final navigation decision. Edit and version-list summaries still parse at most
600 source characters.

Creation and Edit have one compact Description control, showing a two-line text
summary or an optional-note hint. It opens a full-screen editor with fixed Close
and Done controls. The founder requested live formatted editing, replacing
Write/Preview tabs. Bold and italic toggle the selected formatting rather than
nesting Markdown markers. One compact toolbar provides local Undo/Redo, Bold,
Italic, text/list options, links and highlight colours. Text options group headings,
lists, quotes, strikethrough, inline code and Clear formatting in a compact panel.
Clear formatting removes style marks and block styles while retaining link
labels/destinations. It preserves the selected range, leaves surrounding inline
styles intact and is one local Undo/Redo step. At a caret it clears stored style
marks for subsequent typing, while retaining the link.
Links can be added, changed or removed while retaining the selected text. Highlight
options are None, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple and Pink; choosing the same colour
again removes it. Additional controls appear only when opened. The toolbar wraps
if text scaling or available width requires it. The toolbar stays at the bottom
of the editor, immediately above the keyboard while typing; native Close/Done
stay at the top. Writing has most of the screen. Text and highlight menus float
above the toolbar without changing the writing area's size or scroll position.
They fit the remaining editor height after keyboard/orientation/text-size changes
and scroll when necessary. A 140 ms opening transition respects Reduce Motion.
Tap the menu button again, tap the document or use Escape to dismiss a menu.
The Highlight button has a small colour indicator reflecting the whole selected
range. Plain text shows a neutral indicator; mixed colours or highlighted/plain
text show a mixed indicator with an accessible mixed-selection label. The palette
marks a colour selected only for a uniform selection.

Putting the caret/selection in a single link opens a compact inspector above the
formatting strip, showing its destination and Open/Edit/Remove/Close. Tapping a
link while editing places the caret and inspects it; it never follows the link.
Open deliberately hands the validated destination to the native link handler;
reader and editor share the same failed-open message. Edit selects the complete
link, including differently formatted words, for the existing link sheet. Remove
keeps the words and other formatting and supports local Undo/Redo. Close keeps
the caret and remains dismissed until leaving/re-entering that link. Inspectors
do not compete with open text, colour or link-entry menus.

Link entry uses a compact bottom sheet within the editor, above the keyboard.
Its address field receives focus and its Cancel/Apply/Remove actions have a separate
padded footer that stays visible while fields scroll if space is tight. Cancel,
tapping outside or Escape return to the original text selection. New links remain
selected after Apply. Touch/pointer taps on formatting tools do not take focus
from the editor. Readiness and initial focus happen once per editor instance;
Expo DOM callback-proxy replacements during native updates must not refocus or
repeat position restoration. Reopening restores the saved cursor/selection and
scroll position only for matching text, including recovered drafts. Selection
orientation is retained; stale offsets are bounded to valid document positions.
First opens put the caret and viewport at the beginning, rather than an end
caret with a top-scrolled long note. Keyboard/content resizing reapplies that
initial or matching saved scroll target until the user interacts, then normal
typing/scrolling takes over. Both the writing viewport and editor content are
observed. The DOM root does not scroll; the writing area owns document scrolling.
A native Opening editor indicator covers startup and stops on readiness or a
load error. The end-caret mismatch is a plausible source of the reported first-open
blank jump. The founder confirmed Read/Meditate now start correctly without
a black jump on the iPhone. Wider bookmark/keyboard/orientation checks remain. `richText/useEditorReady.ts` owns this boundary.

Select words and paste a full web or app URL to turn the words into a link,
retaining their other formatting and selection. Pasting onto an existing linked
phrase changes its destination. This is one local Undo/Redo step, separate from
adjacent typing. It works through the normal paste event, with no background
clipboard reading. The explicit link sheet remains available. Ordinary text,
bare domains, empty cursors, code and multi-block selections follow the normal
paste path. Executable/local-resource URLs are not made into links. Oversized
link formatting is rejected by the same atomic description limit.

The editor has its own temporary Undo/Redo history, separate from app History.
Typing groups after 500 ms of inactivity; toolbar formatting actions are separate
steps. Editing after Undo clears the editor's Redo branch. This session history
holds at most 100 steps and is not recovered with a draft or exported. Done still
applies one normal habit change. Opening and closing without edits, or undoing
back to the initial document, retains the original Markdown bytes.

Done from a creation/edit dialog updates that dialog's draft. The habit is only
saved when the outer Done is used; outer Close discards it. Done from statistics
applies one normal undoable habit edit immediately. Close asks before discarding
changed text. Blank/whitespace-only text removes the optional field. Newline
normalization preserves indentation and other meaningful Markdown whitespace.
Notes are limited to 20,000 UTF-16 characters; the counter appears near the limit.
These preview/size choices are implementation decisions, not new product goals.

## Markdown and links

`markdown-it` 15.0.2's browser build parses text into tokens; `DescriptionText.tsx`
renders native text/views. Supported content includes headings, bold/italic,
strikethrough, paragraphs, lists, quotes, code and optional highlights.
Yellow highlights use `==text==`; other named colours use `=={green}text==`
(with blue, purple and pink also supported). This is a small OnPurpose Markdown
extension with a fixed palette, not arbitrary HTML or styles. Native readers,
History comparisons and the editor use the same syntax. Other Markdown apps may
show the highlight delimiters literally. Plain URLs become links.
Raw HTML is displayed as text. Tables are not enabled. Image syntax displays its
alt text, without fetching remote images when a note is opened.

Links open through the operating system only on an intentional tap. Explicit
HTTPS/HTTP, mailto and app note links (such as obsidian) are supported; relative
URLs, malformed addresses and executable/local-resource schemes are rejected.
If the target app cannot open a link, the user sees an error. Link text is
underlined and uses the habit colour when readable, with a contrast fallback.
Markdown itself requires no account, network connection or external editor.

The live editor uses Tiptap/ProseMirror in a local Expo DOM component. Only the
full-screen writing surface uses this embedded web editor; the grid, statistics,
notes reader and saved data remain native. Expo SDK 57 includes its DOM WebView in
Expo Go. `@expo/metro-runtime` supports the embedded bundle. JavaScript, CSS and
HTML are bundled with the app; no CDN, server or account is required. The safe
reader parser feeds a limited editor schema; HTML stays literal, and image metadata
is retained with an alt-text placeholder rather than a fetched image. Done/Close
request a current document snapshot across the DOM bridge before applying or
confirming a discard, so the last keystroke need not wait for draft autosave.
Serialized formatting also counts toward the 20,000-character limit; an oversized
paste is rejected as a whole, with existing text and Undo retained.

`richText/selectionLinkPaste.ts` owns the selected-text paste shortcut;
`richText/useFloatingMenuSpace.ts` sizes overlay menus locally without sending
per-frame layout through the native bridge. No storage schema changes are needed.

## History and durable storage

Descriptions are an optional `description` string on v7 habit definitions.
Before/after definitions use the existing atomic event/projection transaction,
serialized writes and visible failure/retry. Creation, ordinary editing, clearing,
Undo/Redo, archive/restore and full backups retain descriptions. Statistics read
the applied description; unfinished text never changes the grid or statistics.
See [STORAGE.md](STORAGE.md).

A description change has a compact Description edited/cleared History row.
Tap it to compare Before and After in a full-screen reader. Restore copies just
the selected description onto the current habit, preserving its current name,
colour, icon, entries and archive status, as a new undoable edit. Restoring an
empty version clears the description. Before/After highlights changed complete
Markdown passages with a subdued background and edge marker: earlier text in
Before, new text in After. The compact Changes switch hides the markers without
changing the text or passage layout. Style/link-destination changes count;
equivalent Markdown delimiter spellings do not. Unchanged passages retain their
normal appearance. Lists/code stay intact; native links remain usable. The reader
virtualizes passages and the pure comparison caps its matching matrix at 250,000
cells, falling back to marking a large unmatched middle while keeping common
ends unchanged. This prevents quadratic memory growth for unrelated long notes. A version already applied cannot be
restored redundantly. Visible History continues to contain active actions only;
Undo removes rows and Redo restores them, while the raw log remains complete.

Versions beside Edit/Add opens a compact, virtualized list of this habit's active
description changes, newest by sequence first. It uses the same Before/After
reader and Restore path as History. Rows include saved time and a short text
summary; only the latest matching applied version is marked Current. Repeated
text is retained because different Before versions may contain recoverable notes.
Cleared notes retain Versions even without a note card. The control is absent
until a description action exists. Initial/seed text is available as Before the
first edit; this is not a second snapshot store. Undo/Redo affect the rows exactly
as in History, with all raw events retained in export. Access from the statistics
card also keeps restoring separate from unfinished creation/edit-form drafts.

## Interrupted drafts

The editor saves local draft text after 350 milliseconds of inactivity and on
backgrounding/unmount, through a serialized queue. Native drafts live in a separate
`onpurpose-description-drafts.db` with schema version 1; browser drafts have a
separate localStorage prefix. These are recoverable writing drafts, outside
History/Undo and full backups. Applied notes remain in the main change log.

Reopening recovers an unsaved draft when its saved-description base still matches.
If the saved note changed meanwhile (including through Undo or backup restore),
a native alert lets the user keep the current saved version or recover the older
draft. Applied/discarded drafts are cleared in queue order, so an earlier write
cannot resurrect them. Draft errors are visible in the editor and do not prevent
Done from using the main store's normal durability/retry path. An abrupt kill
before a debounce/background write completes can lose the most recent keystrokes.

Creation uses one recoverable new-habit description slot; it does not recover the
whole name/icon/colour form. Sample-mode notes and drafts stay entirely in memory
and disappear on full reload. They cannot write to real drafts or real habit data.

Version-2 local draft JSON optionally includes validated anchor/head/scrollTop;
version-1 drafts remain readable without being rewritten. No draft SQL schema or
main v7 event/export change is needed. Separate `position:` keys in the same local
draft store retain clean, text-matched bookmarks after Done. An unchanged note
closed normally retains its location. Discarded text does not replace the applied
note's bookmark. An outer creation/edit Done transfers the matching position to
the saved habit, including a new habit's actual ID, then removes unfinished text.
That read/bookmark/discard sequence occupies one serialized operation so reopening
and writing a fresh draft cannot interleave with its cleanup.
Old clean buffers with a different saved-description base are ignored rather
than offered as unsaved recovery. Real unfinished/conflicting drafts keep the
existing recovery choice. Position-only changes do not enter History or backups.

Selection/scroll reporting waits for a 250 ms pause within the DOM component.
Unchanged documents send position only; pending edits report text and position
together. Editing stays immediate locally. Text reporting now waits for a 200 ms
quiet period with a one-second deadline during continuous typing; native draft
writes still debounce for 350 ms. Done/Close cancel queued copies and request an
exact text-and-position snapshot. DOM visibility/page-hide and native background
snapshot requests flush current text rather than relying on quiet-period timers. A sudden
kill before these debounce windows can lose the last location/keystrokes. Sample
positions use only the isolated in-memory adapter. Keyboard, orientation and
large-text restoration still need physical-iPhone acceptance.

## Requested placeholder notes

Each preset has a short fictional Markdown note and a clearly illustrative
`example.com` link. The development statistics sample includes these notes.
Fresh real-store initialization includes them once.

For a pre-description store, `storage/presetDescriptions.ts` adds placeholders
through normal undoable edits to existing habits, including custom and archived
habits. Custom habits receive a generic note rather than an invented motivation.
Existing descriptions and any past assignment/removal/Undo are preserved. Raw
history prevents repeating the update after Undo or reload. New v7 custom habits
start with an optional empty description and receive no automatic placeholder.
No store is reset or reseeded. Older backups may receive the one-time update on
next opening; a restore itself still reproduces the validated archive exactly.

## Change navigation and editing icons

Before/After includes Next change beside the Changes switch. It moves to the next
changed passage after the viewed position, cycles through targets and wraps to
the first; it enables highlighting if necessary. With no changes it is disabled.
Each version has its own scroll list. Long, variable-height notes can require
measurement: an estimated offset brings the region into view, followed by a
bounded exact-position retry. Manual scrolling, a newer request or closing cancels
old retries. Reduce Motion disables animated navigation. Pure navigation tests
cover cycling, cancellation and unmeasured targets; native feel needs phone QA.

The editing toolbar and text/list menu use consistent Tabler outline SVGs from
the existing installed catalogue, preserving accessible labels, active states and
the highlight-colour indicator. A generated fourteen-icon subset avoids importing
the complete catalogue into the DOM editor. Regenerate it with
`node scripts/generate-editor-icons.mjs`; the existing Tabler MIT notice applies.

Descriptions and all editor controls follow Settings → Text size and the iPhone
text-size multiplier. There is no separate description-size preference. The
keyboard toolbar and menus wrap or scroll while keeping minimum touch targets.

## Large-note performance experiment

The founder requested progressively longer descriptions to test opening statistics
and editing. Isolated Sample data now assigns Go for a walk 1,874 characters,
Read 7,723 and Meditate 17,657. Each is fictional Markdown with ordinary paragraphs,
headings, lists, links, quotes and highlights. Other sample notes and every real
preset description remain unchanged. Full reload or Reset sample data installs
them only in the in-memory sample store; they never migrate into the real store.

`RichDescription` memoizes parsed initial content and disables transaction-driven
whole-component rerenders; toolbar state still updates through useEditorState.
The initial parsed document primes byte-preserving snapshots, avoiding a second
Markdown parse on first typing. Validation, draft reporting and Done share exact
serialization through per-editor weak caches keyed by immutable ProseMirror
nodes. Every changed document still receives full formatting-aware length
validation before acceptance. Unchanged snapshots preserve original Markdown
bytes, including after local Undo. No incremental serialization shortcuts or
new storage format are introduced.

`descriptionUpdateQueue.ts` batches bridge reporting, not keystrokes, formatting
or Undo. Its independent maximum deadline prevents continuous typing from
postponing every draft update. Position-only callbacks avoid retransmitting a
long unchanged note. Native recovery and history semantics remain unchanged;
a sudden kill before reporting/draft writes can still lose recent input.
Creation/edit previews and version-list excerpts are also bounded, with the edit
form memoizing its summary.

Local Node/jsdom diagnostics on all three sizes counted 75 serializations for
25 edits plus 25 repeated snapshots before the change, and 25 after caching.
This verifies duplicate-work removal, not iPhone frame rates or opening latency.
Automated tests cover exact snapshot parity, original-byte Undo, strict atomic
length rejection, quiet/deadline/flush/cancel behaviour, reader text/numbering,
cache eviction and sample isolation. Physical-iPhone opening, typing, scrolling,
keyboard, background recovery and the experimental layout remain acceptance tests.
